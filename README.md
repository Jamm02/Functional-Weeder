# Introduction

This project is a part of the International Robotics Competition [E-yantra ](https://portal.e-yantra.org/). The goal of this project will be that two Alpha-Bots can communicate over the internet using the [Phoenix Framework](https://phoenixframework.org/) and complete the problem statement in the shortest time possible. The code for path planning and path traversal will be written in a functional programming language [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).
The code will be run on the Alpha-Bot where Raspberry Pi will be used as MCU.


# Problem Statement
Teams will be provided with two arenas which will be an abstraction of a farming field where the robots need to perform the task of sowing plant seed and weeding the weed stocks.
Two or more Alpha-Bots need to be used to complete the task of sowing and weeding 5 plants placed on random positions on the arena and a minimum of two arenas should be used.
