  Connect to the Phoenix Server URL (defined in config.exs) via socket.
  Once ensured that socket is connected, join the channel on the server with topic "robot:status".
  Get the channel's PID in return after joining it.
  NOTE:
  The socket will automatically attempt to connect when it starts.
  If the socket becomes disconnected, it will attempt to reconnect automatically.
  Please note that start_link is not synchronous,
  so you must wait for the socket to become connected before attempting to join a channel.
